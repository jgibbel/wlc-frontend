                <h1> WLC Mentoring Program</h1>
                <p className="indent-more p">
                We are thrilled to announce a new initiative we have designed to help other women EDs/CEOs/Presidents of NYC based social enterprises navigate “all the stuff” related to COVID-19.</p>
                <p className="indent-more p">Our members have shared gratitude for this group, especially during this time of COVID-19, in so many ways. At the same time, we have all received requests to open up the WLC doors to more leaders who need help right now. We believe we have designed something that answers all these questions. </p>
                <p className="indent-more p">This new pilot program is open to any woman who:</p>
                <ul className="indent-more p">
                    <li>is currently a ED/CEO/President of a NYC based social enterprise</li>
                    <li>has had at least one year of senior leadership experience and</li>
                    <li>is NOT currently a member of the WLC</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="indent-more p">Mentoring will start in April and go through September 18th and will largely be conducted through virtual meet-ups and email communications. Mentors will be current or former EDs/CEOs/Presidents who are current members, alumnae or friends of the WLC with at least 7 years of experience as a senior leader of a social enterprise.</p>
                <p className="indent-more p">Current WLC members may nominate up to two leaders who meet these criteria and all nominations must be submitted by no later than April 20, 2020. Any woman interested in being mentored should reach out to a current member of the WLC to request a nomination or send an email to info@wlcsocialimpact.com.</p>
